### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fakhri Nail Wibowo, otherwise known as Kiki.
I am an Informatics Engineering student in ITB.
I'm trying to learn as much as possible to find my true passion in the programming world! So far I've tried several programming languages such as Python, C, C++, C#, and Matlab, I have also tried game development using Unity.
