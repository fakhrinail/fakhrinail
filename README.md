### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fakhri Nail Wibowo, otherwise known as Kiki.

I am an Informatics Engineering student in ITB.

I am trying to learn as much as possible to find my true passion in the programming world! So far I've experimented with web development and app development. My tech stack in web development is React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js and also Typescript. Right now, I am focusing in mobile development in Android after graduating through Bangkit Academy 2022.
