### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fakhri Nail Wibowo, otherwise known as Kiki.

I am an Informatics Engineering student in ITB.

I am trying to learn as much as possible to find my true passion in the programming world! So far I've experimented with several programming languages, I have also explored game development using Unity.

Currently I am learning web development and working on a robot project at KRPAI ITB.
