### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fakhri Nail Wibowo, otherwise known as Kiki.
I am an Informatics Engineering student in ITB.
I'm trying to learn as much as possible to find my true passion in the programming world! So far I've experimented with several programming languages such as Python, C and its siblings, Java and Matlab, I have also explored game development using Unity.
