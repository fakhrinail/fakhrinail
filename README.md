### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fakhri Nail Wibowo, otherwise known as Kiki.

I am a fresh graduate of Informatics Engineering at ITB. My thesis is a static analysis tool built to detect injection vulnerabilities in multiple languages, such as Java, Javascript, Python, and PHP.

I have a lot of hands-on experience in software engineering, due to extracurricular activities, freelance projects, and internships. I am comfortable with frontend, backend, and mobile development. My tech stacks are React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, Javascript, Typescript, Go, and Kotlin. My focus currently is on backend development as I am adding my skills with Go, but I welcome any other opportunities should you have one!
